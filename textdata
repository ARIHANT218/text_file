OOPS --


1. Polymorphism  : It is the concept of oops. Polymorphism is the ability of a single function and methos or operator behave differently
based of the input .
Type of polymorphism :
1. Compile time ploy  2. run time ploy
Compile time polymorphism --Occur when the method to be executed is determined at compile time. ususallly operator overloading ..
run time ploy -- Occurs when the method to be executed is determined at run time ploy .

Inheritance : It is the concept of oops . When derive class access the property and charac  of the parent class is known as inheritance.
 In java Multiple inheritance is not possible . Using interface can be implement multpile inheritance . 

Interafce is just like a class , which contains the abstract methods and variables . 

Encapsulation : it is the concept of oops .  Encapsulation  wrapped the method and variables into the single unit . AND ALSO HIDING THE DATA FROM USER
 . BY DECLARE  THE CLASS WRAAPED  THE METHOS AND VARIABLES AND USING MODIFIER LIKE PRIVATE AND PROTECT 
EASLY HIDE THE DATA FROM USER .


Abstraction in Java : IT HIDING THE INTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND SHOWONLY ESSENTIAL DETILS TO THE USER.
IN JAVA TWO WAYS ARE POSSIBLE ...
1. INTERFACE  2.  ABSTRACT CLASSES.  ... RFEAL LIFE EXAMPLE IS TV AND BUTTON.
